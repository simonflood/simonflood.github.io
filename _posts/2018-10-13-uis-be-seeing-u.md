After just over 18.5 years working in the central IT services department of the
University of Cambridge yesterday was my last day.

During my time in the University Computing Service/[University Information
Services (UIS)](https://www.uis.cam.ac.uk) I worked in three areas: the
University's open access IT facilities (Public Workstation Facility/Managed
Cluster Service), Networks, and
[High Performance/Research Computing](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk). I worked for
4 different Directors and saw (and was involved with) various changes including
the move of the department from the centre of Cambridge to the University's
West Cambridge site, the West Cambridge Data Centre, and the formation of UIS
itself (by merging the Computing Service and Management Information Services
Division and then later the High Performance Computing Service).

On Monday I start in the
[MRC Biostatistics Unit (BSU)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk) within the
University's School of Clinical Medicine as their Linux System Administrator.
