At the beginning of November 2009 I received an email out of the blue from Kim
Groneman at Novell letting me know that I had been nominated and subsequently
selected to be one of 25
[Novell Knowledge Partners](http://support.novell.com/community/nkp.html). This
was a program covering Novell (who had previously acquired SUSE) and openSUSE
contributions to the user community.

Kim said that my nomination was based on my knowledge sharing contributions
over the previous year which were mostly to the Novell
[Technology Transfer Partners](https://thettp.org) (TTP) group.

It was an honour to be nominated and I quickly replied to accept and so started
an interesting experience. Little did I know that this would last eleven years
until the end of October 2020 when I formally resigned from the Micro Focus
Knowledge Partner program.

Whilst I haven't been using Micro Focus products for some time, I was still
able to read and understand documentation, install software/servers, etc., and
help out in the forums. Between
[changing jobs](/blog/2018/10/13/uis-be-seeing-u), the end of NNTP access to
the forums (my primary method of reading and replying to posts), and the new
[community site](https://community.microfocus.com/) replacing the forums, I
felt that it was the right time to formally leave the program. This doesn't
mean that my previous contributions will disappear as my posts should
still continue to exist associated with my username
[smflood](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/192797)
(and a few with
[smflood1](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/223563)).

During my eleven years as a Novell/Micro Focus Knowledge Partner, Novell were
bought by Attachmate which became known as The Attachmate Group with Novell and
SUSE operating as two separate business units. Then Micro Focus bought The
Attachmate Group and later sold the SUSE business unit to EQT Partners.

I have fond memories of my time as a Knowledge Partner and the opportunities,
experiences, and friendships that it brought me (and my wife). I will always
be grateful to Kim for contacting and inviting me to be part of the program and
for his support to myself and the rest of the Knowledge Partners. Thanks also
to the staff who in addition to their day jobs were our support route into the
company - for me these were Pam Robello, Shaun Pond (who himself later became a
Knowledge Partner), Craig Wilson, and Hans van den Heuvel.

Some of the opportunities and experiences included attending three Novell
BrainShare conferences (in 2010, 2011, and 2013) and the first six SUSECON
conferences (from 2012 to 2017). I was fortunate enough to present during
Novell BrainShare 2010 (Integrating Apple Macs using Novell technologies) and
SUSECON 2016 (Getting Started with SUSE OpenStack Cloud 6). My wife and I were
also able to participate in a Knowledge Partner retreat in Utah in October 2010
as well as spend some time with other Knowledge Partners at Walt Disney World
Resort in Orlando before SUSECON 2013. I was very happy to win a Samsung Galaxy
Note 10.1 Android tablet at SUSECON 2013 because it became an invaluable tool
for responding to forum posts whilst sitting in front of the TV!

I wish all of those associated with and running the Micro Focus Knowledge
Partner program well. I recently joked about buying some Micro Focus shares at
their then low price - I wish I had as they've since increased in value by over
50%!

It is currently my intention to continue as a SUSE Knowledge Partner.
