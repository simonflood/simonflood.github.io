In May 2015, when the build phase of our kitchen and dining extension was
nearing completion, I bought my first Sonos products, two Connect:Amps. Whilst
not cheap, a home audio system was one of the things I had wanted to install in
the extension but not wanting wall-mounted or floor/furniture standing speakers
creating clutter I decided on ceiling speakers. During the first fix speaker
cable was run from three locations back to the cupboard under the stairs as
given the layout of the extension I'd opted for three stereo ceiling speakers
(Canton 865 DT). Fortunately you can [connect two speakers to one
Connect:Amp](https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4730) so I needed two
Connect:Amps rather than three. Within the Sonos app I then grouped the two
"rooms" so that the same audio played out of all three speakers.

In January 2016 I bought a Play:1 for an upstairs bedroom used as a study and
then in November 2016 I bought an Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) for the
extension ready to add voice control (though Sonos did not enable this until
almost a year later in October 2017).

![Sonos email - end of software updates](/assets/images/Sonos-email-1.png){: style="float: right; margin-left: 1em"}
On 21 January I received an email from Sonos letting me know that from May the
two Connect:Amps I owned would "be classified as legacy and no longer receive
software updates and new features [which would] affect [my] listening
experience." The email also said "that because Sonos is a system, all products
operate on the same software" and "if modern products remain connected to
legacy products after May, they also will not receive software updates and new
features."

![Sonos email - you have options](/assets/images/Sonos-email-2.png){: style="float: right; margin-left: 1em"}
The same email then said that I had options and offered two: the first to
continue as is but no longer receive software updates and new features which is
likely, over time, to disrupt access to services and overall functionality. The
second to save 30% on new Sonos products when trading up my legacy ones. Of
course there are other options, more of which later.

Finally the email included a link to a [Sonos support article "to learn more
about what the end of software updates means for [my] listening
experience"](https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4786) and said to contact
Sonos if I have any additional questions. This article in turn had a link to
another listing [legacy and modern
products](https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4798) which would be more useful
if it included manufacturing periods for all products and serial number ranges
to help identify product revisions.

On the same day Sonos published a [marketing version of why software updates
are ending for their oldest
products](https://blog.sonos.com/en-gb/end-of-software-updates-for-legacy-products/)
though they glossed over the impact on existing Sonos customers.

There was so much wrong with the email and support articles!

* Less than 5 years after buying two Sonos products they would stop receiving
software updates which would affect my listening experience
  - I can accept not receiving updates but it shouldn't stop them working!
  - It also shouldn't compromise my listening experience!
  - Does this also mean all Sonos products are only supported for ~5 years?
* Because of this my other Sonos product would also stop receiving updates etc.
  - Why? Change the system so can run split versions or (preferably) push a
"lite" update to older devices (don't need code for functions they can't support)
* A hint of blackmail
  - Upgrade or else!
* With less than four months until May it was a bit short notice
* 30% off the replacement Sonos product (Amp) is still a lot of money
  - 30% off RRP of £599 is more than I paid for each Connect:Amp!
  - 30% also doesn't seem so generous when Sonos offered 20% off home cinema
for last year's Black Friday promotion
* Trading up bricks the legacy product meaning it's only good for landfill or
parts (depending on how it's bricked)
* Lack of details

This news probably explains the emails from Sonos in November introducing and
pushing their Trade Up program, obviously targeted at Sonos customers with
legacy products.

Unsurprisingly I wasn't the only person unhappy with this news and the internet
was alive not just with the sound of unhappy and angry Sonos customers but also
potential (and now lost) customers.

![Letter from Sonos CEO](/assets/images/Sonos-letter.png){: style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;"}
On 23 January [Patrick Spence, Sonos CEO, published a
letter](https://blog.sonos.com/en/a-letter-from-our-ceo/) which I then received
as an email on 25 January. In it he said that "come May, when [Sonos] end new
software updates for [their] legacy products, they will continue to work just
as they do today" and that "whilst legacy Sonos products won't get new software
features, [Sonos] pledge to keep them updated with bug fixes and security
patches for as long as possible." However there was a note that "if [Sonos] run
into something core to the experience that can't be addressed, [Sonos will]
work to offer an alternative solution ..." He also said that Sonos are "working
on a way to split [my] system so that modern products work together and get the
latest features, whilst legacy products work together and remain in their
current state. [Sonos are] finalizing details on this plan and will share more
in the coming weeks." He then went on to say that "[Sonos] want [their]
customers to upgrade to [their] latest and greatest products when [customers
are] excited by what the new products offer, not because [customers] feel
forced to do so. That's the intent of the trade up programme [Sonos] launched
for [their] loyal customers". Finally he thanked customers for being Sonos
customers, giving feedback, and "[hoped] that [I'll] forgive [their] misstep
and let [Sonos] earn back [my] trust."

Basically a grovelling attempt at damage limitation following Sonos' [Gerald
Ratner moment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ratner_moment). Patrick used the
words "loyal" and "trust" but those are the words Sonos customers (once)
thought about their relationship with Sonos. Yes he provided some reassurance
but again it was lacking details and suggested that Sonos haven't actually
thought this all through, something [my Twitter conversation with
@SonosSupport](https://twitter.com/simon_flood/status/1220429698716569605)
seemed to confirm.

Fortunately I didn't buy a Sonos Sub in December when I saw it at £465 (a 33.5%
reduction against RRP!) on Amazon UK.

Could Sonos have given more than 4 months notice? Not only was the Trade Up
program launched on 1 November but Sonos' [Form 10-K for Q4
2019](https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2019/q4/52d86c5b-248f-4939-aa85-1489c1828e7f.pdf)
included a revealing (and prophetic) risk factor (see page 17 of the PDF).

![Sonos 10-K filing Q4 2019](/assets/images/Sonos-10K-2019Q4.png)

Would more notice have made any difference? Not really and I actually think it
would have been worse for Sonos if it had been coupled with the launch of their
Trade Up program which has been derided for not being environmentally friendly.

With all of Sonos' blog posts and support articles it surprises me that one of
the most useful pieces of information is a graph published on the [Facebook
page for Phonos (Sonos App)](https://www.facebook.com/Phonos.application/)
which shows memory and storage of Sonos products.

![Sonos Player Memory Over Time graph @ 25 January](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p417x417/83065904_2990166664327357_1562782790485803008_o.png?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ohc=I-2qICb-fusAX-am2M2&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=09187ba86af74a663abad79f581dca95&oe=5ECB5179)

Personally I think Sonos should publish this information on their web site
rather than leaving it to a third party to do so. 

The same Facebook page also has a tip for finding out the amount of memory and
flash storage in your Sonos products - for each product visit
`http://ipaddress:1400/xml/device_description.xml` (replacing *ipaddress* as
appropriate) and then look for &lt;memory&gt; and &lt;flash&gt;.

If you're a Linux or Mac user you could use the following command (possibly in
a loop of IP addresses) to get this information.

~~~
$ curl --silent http://ipaddress:1400/xml/device_description.xml | egrep '\<(displayName|roomName|memory|flash)\>'
~~~

Unfortunately this confirmed that both my Connect:Amps have 32MB of both memory
and flash storage. However my Play:1 isn't far behind with 128MB of memory and
64MB flash storage so I don't think it will be long before that is reclassified as legacy.

As for what to now do, my options would appear to be

1. As per Sonos' first option do (and purchase) nothing and see what (if
anything) happens in May
  - This is the cheapest option, at least in the short term
2. As per Sonos' second option trade up legacy Sonos products
  - At 30% off this is costly and each trade up would cost me more than I paid
in the first place
  - Discount needs to be improved
  - Can't combine trade ups to get bigger discount off one Sonos product
  - Will trade up be possible from May?
3. Sell legacy Sonos products
  - Whilst I haven't been tracking Sonos resale values, prices don't seem to
have plummeted though I think they are on a downward trend
  - Equivalent replacement Sonos products are still expensive
  - Would need to replace with (or do) something else
4. Sell all Sonos products
  - Would lose some money but at least I hadn't (yet) spent thousands
  - Ceiling speakers in extension would still remain
  - Whilst I could manage without Play:1 in study I'd need something to drive
three, or at least one, ceiling speaker
  - Would need to replace with (or do) something else
5. Buy more legacy Sonos products
  - Gamble that legacy Sonos products will still work from May
  - Second-hand legacy Sonos products are (considerably) cheaper than new
modern Sonos products
  - Risk of buying legacy Sonos products that are in Recycle Mode
6. Buy more modern Sonos products
  - Trading up legacy Sonos products for modern Sonos equivalents wouldn't add
to my Sonos system
  - Before this news I was thinking of one or two amps and a soundbar (latter
would require a new TV)
  - What happens in 5 years time?
7. Buy [IKEA
SYMFONISK](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/news/symfonisk-collection-pubaafe6500)
products
  - Cheaper than buying Sonos Amp plus ceiling speaker(s) for bedrooms
8. Buy [Amazon Echo Link Amp](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Link-Amp-/dp/B07FRH12Y6)
  - I have an Amazon Echo Dot
  - Whilst cheaper than Sonos Amp I've read some bad reviews
  - Doesn't appear to support Google Play Music/YouTube Music
9. Buy/do something else

I like Sonos and don't want to see them fail, not least because that could
affect the operation of my whole Sonos system and not just the legacy products,
but the market has changed since I bought my Sonos products and there are now
alternatives.

ZDNet recently published an article on the [idea of an open source audio
system](https://www.zdnet.com/article/so-long-sonos-meet-the-open-source-audio-system-that-will-never-die/)
but I can't see Sonos et al backing this. However I do think open source is the
way to go and as a Raspberry Pi enthusiast I'm already thinking of using these
with DAC HATs - [HiFiBerry](https://www.hifiberry.com/) have already confirmed
to me that their [Amp2
HAT](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/boards/hifiberry-amp2/) can easily handle
my ceiling speakers. Two attractions of a Raspberry Pi-based solution are cost
and flexibility but it will require some time to investigate and implement.

Stay tuned.

Simon
