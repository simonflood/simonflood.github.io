As of today I have joined [Securelinx](https://securelinx.com), an enterprise Linux and open source solutions provider, as a Linux Engineer Consultant.

Whilst Securelinx is based in Dublin, Ireland, I'll be working from home in the UK, but travelling to Dublin once a month for one or two days at a time. I'm already booked to meet up with them 7-8 September!

Although I've previously met some of the team, I'm looking forward to seeing everyone, learning new things, and getting involved with some interesting projects.

They also happen to be a SUSE One Partner.
